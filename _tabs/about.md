# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Joshua Berry, an IT Engineer with a strong interest in home lab environments and open-source software. My career began with a hands-on, all-in-one IT role where I had to learn quickly and adapt to a wide range of technical challenges. That experience sparked my passion for home labs and self-hosted solutions.

I now focus on creating clear, straightforward documentation to help others set up and use some of the best tools the home lab and open-source communities have to offer.
