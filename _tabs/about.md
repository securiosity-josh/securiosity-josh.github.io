# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Joshua Berry, an IT Engineer with a practical background in solving a wide range of technical problems. I started my career in a generalist role where I had to quickly get up to speed on everything from networking and hardware to software and support. That kind of environment forced me to learn fast and work through problems hands-on, which is where I first developed an interest in building and maintaining home lab environments.

Over time, that interest has grown into a deeper passion. As I've had the chance to work with more technologiesâ€”virtualization platforms, container orchestration, self-hosted services, and automation toolsâ€”Iâ€™ve found that home labs are not just a place to experiment, but a way to keep learning in a focused, meaningful way. Itâ€™s where I test ideas, break things, and figure out how to fix them.

I also put a lot of effort into writing documentation thatâ€™s easy to follow. I know how frustrating vague instructions can be, so I aim to share guides that are practical and written for people who just want to get something up and running without the confusion. Whether it's a walkthrough for a new self-hosted service or a write-up on setting up a secure environment, I try to make it something I would have wanted when I was learning.
