# Installing Proxmox VE and Setup Tutorial

Do you need to virtualize something at home? Thinking of building your own Homelab? (The answer is YES).Join me as we install and configure Proxmox VE step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

- 64-bit processor with virtualization support (Intel VT/AMD-V)
- At least 2 GB RAM (4 GB or more recommended)
- Storage: 32 GB minimum
- Bootable USB drive or CD/DVD with Proxmox VE ISO

## Steps

### 1. Download Proxmox VE ISO

- Visit the [Proxmox Downloads page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).
- Download the latest Proxmox VE ISO installer.

### 2. Create a Bootable USB

- Use tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/macOS) to write the ISO to a USB drive.

### 3. Boot from USB

- Insert the USB drive into your server.
- Boot and select the USB drive as the boot device.

### 4. Install Proxmox VE

- Select **Install Proxmox VE** from the boot menu.
- Accept the license agreement.
- Choose the target hard disk for installation.
- Configure country, time zone, and keyboard layout.
- Set a password for the root user and provide an email address.
- Configure network settings (hostname, IP address, etc.).

### 5. Complete Installation

- After installation, remove the USB drive and reboot.
- Access the Proxmox web interface at:  
    `https://<your-server-ip>:8006`

- Dont worry about the warning Proxmox runs a self signed certificate just click the advanced drop down and continue. 

### 6. Initial Setup

Now that we've booted and loaded into the web user interface I like to take some extra steps to finish off my setup before I start creating virtual machines or containers.

- Log in with the root account and the password set during installation.
- Run the post install script from the community scripts in the shell tab. 
    
```shell
    bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"
```
*This script provides options for managing Proxmox VE repositories, including disabling the Enterprise Repo, adding or correcting PVE sources, enabling the No-Subscription Repo, adding the test Repo, disabling the subscription nag, updating Proxmox VE, and rebooting the system.*

You can of course do this manually but for this article I will use the script.

- Run through the options on the script and reboot the system

We're now ready to create some virtual machines and LXC containers.
