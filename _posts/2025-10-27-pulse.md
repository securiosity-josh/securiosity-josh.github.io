I think all of us are looking for very cool tools that can add modern dashboards to Proxmox and to help monitor what is going on with your Proxmox host, cluster hosts, VMs, and LXC containers. There is a new open source project that can do just that. It is called Pulse. Pulse is a new and exciting community tool that is available for monitoring Proxmox. Letâ€™s take a look at the features and capabilities that Pulse brings to the table.

## What is Pulse?

Pulse is an open-source monitoring platform that you can run completely free for monitoring, it was purpose built for Proxmox VE Server. It leverages Proxmox API to talk directly to your host and yields a clean dashboard where you can see metrics from your nodes and virtual machines... But it doesnt stop there.

## Installing Pulse Monitoring in a Docker container

Installation is fairly simple with docker compose, with a fairly minimal configuration required inside the compose file we will do most of the configuration in the web browser later on. As always ill put my docker compose files under the directory ```docker_volumes/{service}```

To Get started we're going to first setup our docker compose file which I've provided below

Couple of notes I've prefilled out the authentication username and password and pre generated an API token for webhooks. Please change these values in a production environment.

```shell
   # docker-compose.yml
services:
  pulse:
    image: rcourtman/pulse:latest
    container_name: pulse
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7655:7655"
    environment:
      # First-boot admin (plain text; Pulse will bcrypt-hash it internally)
      PULSE_AUTH_USER: admin
      PULSE_AUTH_PASS: Letmein1$ #ChangeMe

      # Pre-generated API token for agents/webhooks
      API_TOKEN: 1bd764fae4c664d7f6158a814f8bf718f9e32e0c88b85fadb3ae2980eeea05f8 #ChangeMe

      # Optional: limit network discovery scope (example)
      # DISCOVERY_SUBNET: "192.168.50.0/24"
    volumes:
      - /data:/data 
```
Save the file and run the below command

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

After the container spins up, you should be able to browse to port 7655 on your Docker host where you spun up the container. We can login and we should be greeted with the below!

We can now work on adding our first PVE host to Pulse, Thankfully they make this the most painless process you could possibly imagine lets go into settings and select add a new PVE Node

![Selecting add node button](/assets/img/body/pulse/adding-a-pve-node.webp)

Filling out the hostname URL ```https://{your_pve_ip}:8006 we can then copy the command and paste it into the proxmox shell. 

![Selecting host command](/assets/img/body/pulse/adding_host.webp)

Now, I have copied the command and logged into the PVE host node, opened the shell prompt and pasted in the command. Run the command. You will see the script stop and prompt you if you want to Enable hardware temperature monitoring for this node? Enter Yes.

Let this complete we should then see our PVE Node inside pulse. We can then move to check out the power of Pulse at a glance.

Almost immdietely we can see we have a really solid overview of all of our containers
