I think all of us are looking for very cool tools that can add modern dashboards to Proxmox and to help monitor what is going on with your Proxmox host, cluster hosts, VMs, and LXC containers. There is a new open source project that can do just that. It is called Pulse. Pulse is a new and exciting community tool that is available for monitoring Proxmox. Letâ€™s take a look at the features and capabilities that Pulse brings to the table.

## What is Pulse?

Pulse is an open-source monitoring platform that you can run completely free for monitoring, it was purpose built for Proxmox VE Server. It leverages Proxmox API to talk directly to your host and yields a clean dashboard where you can see metrics from your nodes and virtual machines... But it doesnt stop there.

## Installing Pulse Monitoring in a Docker container

Installation is fairly simple with docker compose, with a fairly minimal configuration required inside the compose file we will do most of the configuration in the web browser later on. 

To Get started we're going to first setup our docker compose file which I've provided below

```shell
   # docker-compose.yml
services:
  pulse:
    image: rcourtman/pulse:latest
    container_name: pulse
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "7655:7655"
    environment:
      # First-boot admin (plain text; Pulse will bcrypt-hash it internally)
      PULSE_AUTH_USER: admin
      PULSE_AUTH_PASS: Letmein1$

      # Pre-generated API token for agents/webhooks
      API_TOKEN: 1bd764fae4c664d7f6158a814f8bf718f9e32e0c88b85fadb3ae2980eeea05f8

      # Optional: limit network discovery scope (example)
      # DISCOVERY_SUBNET: "192.168.50.0/24"
    volumes:
      - /home/linuxadmin/homelabservices/pulse/data:/data 
```
